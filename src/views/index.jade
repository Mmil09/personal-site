						span I am a professional software engineer working in a small, fast-paced startup environment, working mainly in JavaScript, Node, and Front End Web Development.  I am excited about the direction of the modern web and the growing ecosystem of JavaScript libraries and frameworks.  As a personal development project, I am currently working on porting a MIDI/audio web application for Mac/Windows desktop use by using Electron library (progress can be currently viewed on my Github account in the 
						a(href="http://github.com/Mmil09/note-writer", target="_blank") Note Writer 
						span repository). Alongside web development, I have also been dabbling in projects for Arduino using C/C++.

				span Outside of software development, I enjoy almost anything that has to do with music and audio. Musical instruments and music production have been hobbies of mine since I was a teenager.  I play guitar, violin, and a little bit of bass and drums.  I also enjoy going to shows at local venues and listening to records.

				span In addition to music, I enjoy being outdoors and hiking with my two dogs, Maxwell and Opal, and my wife, Liz.  I also enjoy traveling, cooking and trying new kinds of cuisine.
